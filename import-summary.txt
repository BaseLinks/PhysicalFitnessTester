ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* AndroidManifest_test.xml
* CleanSpec.mk
* lib/
* lib/mapapi/
* lib/mapapi/com/
* lib/mapapi/com/android/
* lib/mapapi/com/android/bluetooth/
* lib/mapapi/com/android/bluetooth/mapapi/
* lib/mapapi/com/android/bluetooth/mapapi/BluetoothMapContract.java
* lib/mapapi/com/android/bluetooth/mapapi/BluetoothMapEmailProvider.java
* tests/
* tests/Android.mk

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => bluetooth/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* jni/ => bluetooth/src/main/jni/
* res/ => bluetooth/src/main/res/
* src/ => bluetooth/src/main/java/
* tests/src/ => bluetooth/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
